I graduated from Indiana University with computer science, math, and Spanish degrees in 2017 and completed my PhD in computer science at UC San Diego in 2024. I am now an assistant professor of practice in the computer science department at Purdue University. Broadly speaking, my research interests include privacy, human-computer interaction, and education.
